 First, click on the Start button on the windows desktop... 
 Browse to where you downloaded the Pirch98.exe file, and click on it.
 Click open, then click ok
 Once the install starts, you will see several screens with options. It is HIGHLY recommended that you accept the default folders at this time. As you gain experience
 with Pirch, you will understand the reason for this. Some of the add-on pils and scripts require these default directories to work properly.

 You will need to make two aliases for this to work properly.
 1. name this F7 
 /nick yournick-away (or brb, or afk, whatever)
 /me will be right back
 /enable 000
 /disable 100
 -
 2. name this F8
 /enable 100
 /disable 000
 /nick yournick
 /timer 1 1 6 /me is back
 -
 these will change your nickname when you have to be away for a few minutes
 (lets others know you aren't there to answer them)
 and turns off your auto get sounds event so you can't be flooded while you're gone
 All you have to do when leaving for a few, is hit the F7 key at the top of your keyboard
 And when you return, hit the F8 key. There IS a required amount of time between nick changes,
 but only on some servers, and I do not know what it is. Probably a minute will work.

?Fix for the "error creating window" bug
 Edit your pirch32.ini file to read aliases=aliases.paf
 and events=events.paf under [Main].
 If the problem still persists, try
 deleting \windows\pirchutil.ini.

?How do you do on text events? Like to ping someone?
 Add this to your events:
 ON TEXT:!ping*:#:/ping $nick
 ON TEXT      : The command to ake action on
 !ping*       : The text to look for, at the beginning of the line.
 #            : Channel to look for it. # means all channels
 /ping $nick  : The command to do when they type it.

?How do I add servers to my server connect list?
 You can add a server by clicking on LOGIN, then
 EDIT SERVER LIST, then  type in the server you
 wish to add (eg: server.something.net). You dont
 really need to change the PORT since most servers
 accept 6667. Then , type in the ID. (ie: Starchat,
 Undernet, Dalnet). Then, hit OK, then  CLOSE. Then,
 when you click on the arrow to choose your server,
 scroll down it should be on the bottom of the list.
 To switch servers WHILE ONLINE, type in:
 /server  new.server.here:6667. Keep in mind you WILL
 disconnect from your current server if you do this.

?How do I see which channels are here?
 Type in  /list

?How can I see the different servers available for
the Net I am on/my server list is SO SMALL for this net?
 Type in   /links ,    then ADD the servers you wish
 into your server list (see Question 1)

?Why do I keep getting server messages/ mass messages
and how do I stop them?
 Click on LOGIN, then UNcheck the box for  "receive server
 messages", and  check in the box for "invisible on server".
 If you are ALREADY logged online, type in:
 /mode yournickname +i-s , and when you log offline, check
 and uncheck the boxes mentioned earlier.

?Sometimes I lose Ops in my channel when on Undernet
or Dalnet etc. Why does pirch do that?
 It is not a pirch problem. If the channel has X/W in there,
 its quite possible that you are on numerics
 (ie: *!*pirch@12.345.67) instead of your usual addy mask.
 (ie: *!*pirch@*.user.com) This can be solved by simply
 logging offline, closing pirch, and logging in again. It
 has to do with the way the server reads your ISPs
 information, and isnt a big deal.

?How do I do "popups"?
 Click on a nickname, then  RIGHT CLICK, and you will
 see a popup menu. Choose the "slam" one for the demo.
 That is a popup.

?Where do I get popups?
 2 ways: FIRST: you can copy/paste from a channel window:
 drag the mouse over all text you want copied, release
 and wait for the highlight to disappear, then hit
 CTRL/C, then click on the POPUPS icon  and choose the
 CHANNEL(names list), then click INSIDE there, then hit
 CTRL/V. YOU MUST PUT a  " .name " before it.
 EXAMPLE: .LoveSymbol:/me  13úìùê*úìùê*úìùê*úìùê4 $$1 13úìùê*úìùê*úìùê*úìùê
 Feel free to copy/paste that into your popups to test.
 SECOND: ^Elviraa^ has a popup file that you can have.
 Type in: !getpop and  she will send it to you. You will have to
 replace your current "popups.irc" file with that one, and
 rename it to "popups.irc". SAVE and RENAME your current
 popups.irc file before doing this in case it does not work.

?How do I play sounds?
 Type in:  /sound #channelname filename.wav
 (ie: /sound #PirchHelp laff.wav) You MUST have the
 wav file to play the sound, and you MUST have the
 correct path set in your preferences. Click on the
 preferences icon, Choose either SOUNDS or MEDIA.
 Check the boxes: "ignore if already playing sounds"
 and "enable sounds".  Make sure you have the correct
 "default sound path" typed in.

?I am having trouble recieving DCC files. What wrong?
 You need to edit your settings for DCCs. Click on
 PREFERENCES, then DCC. If you have a 28.8 or faster
 modem, edit your "packet size" to read  8192, and
 your  "timeouts" for  both CHAT and FILE to 9999.
 If you have a 14.4 modem, packet size should be
 set to 4096.  MAKE SURE your default download paths
 are the same as the path you have set in your
 SOUNDS or MEDIA "default sound path", and UNcheck
 the boxes for "autoaccept files" and "autoaccept chat".
 You MAY check the boxes for "auto minimize DCC windows" ,
 "auto close DCC windows upon completion" and "keep DCC
 transaction log". If after modifying your settings you
 still have trouble, disconnect and RESTART Pirch.

?My fonts look retarded...help!
 Click the PREFERENCES icon and choose FONTS. You can
 edit your settings there.

?Can I change the color of my screen and text?
 YUP! Click on OPTIONS on your menu bar. Click on COLORS.
 You can edit your settings there.

?How do I change my nickname?
 Type in:   /nick  YourNewNickname

?How do I see if someone is online?
 Type in:  /whois TheirNickname
 If you know their *!*user@*.host.com, you can use
 the USER part and type in: /who  TheUserPart
 (example: for *!*Ehhh@*.blah.com you would type /who Ehhh )
 Unless they are +i (invisible), you will get a list of
 everyone online with that USER part.

?Someone is bothering me and wont stop. HELP!
 In pirch, all you have to do is type: /ignore nickname.
 If later you wish to remove the ignore, click your
 PREFERENCES icon, then choose IGNORE, click on their
 nickname on the list, click REMOVE, then hit OK.

?Can I direct downloads to a SPECIFIC directory?
 Yes. Click on OPTIONS on your menu bar. Choose "Download
 Extension Map".  Click ADD, then type in the file extensions
 you wish to direct in this format: wav;mid (you MUST use the ; )
 Then type in the directory you wish them to go to. Check the box
 "Save to disk". If you need to use a helper-application to play
 the file, such as a video player (for AVIs or MPGs), check
 the box for EXECUTE HELPER APPLICATION and type in ITS path
 (ie: C:\Netoob). THEN, click OK.

?How come I don't get on the Web when I click on an "HTTP:\"
in a chat window or channel?
 Click on TOOLS on your menu bar, click on WORLD WIDE WEB LINKS,
 then click OPTIONS, find your browser or type in the path
 (ie: C:\iexplore), check the box "PURGE UNUSED URLs",  then click DONE.

?Are there some basic settings I need to know about?
 Yes. Click on your PREFERENCES icon, and put checks
 in to following boxes:
 * GENERAL:  "Private notice destination": ACTIVE WINDOW
 * "Private notices/messages": USE DEDICATED MESSAGE WINDOWS
 * MINIMIZE NEW MESSAGE WINDOWS
 * BEEP ON PRIVATE MESSAGE
 * "Scroll buffer size" : set this to: 230

 * CTCP:  Check the box: "AUTOMATIC CTCP FLOOD CONTROL"

   notified of when they log online here.
 * CHECK the boxes for: ENABLE NOTIFY and  NOTIFY TO ACTIVE WINDOW

   someone by accident who is using your friends nickname.

   and ENABLE BAN PROTECTION. Put nicknames in here
   sparingly as it may cause problems with others
   who may have set their  PROTECTION too.

   AUTO RE-WRAP TEXT. Any others will be your own personal preference.
 * "Default sign off message" : Type in what you want

 1st: Close the Media Player
 2nd: Type /remini c:\windows\pirchutil.ini IrcMediaPlayer

 3rd: That particular bug can be prevented by making by making
      sure media player is not rolled up when you exit Pirch.
