"Wow, another real doc file." - Yea, don't get used to them.

"You still hate writting doc files, don't you?" - What do you think?

 +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Unlike most of my scripts, this one will need some configuration and setup
before it will run correctlly. The following areas need attention.

-Main Script - cmdchar_ variable------------------------------------------------
Set this variable to a trigger charactor. Default is !. This will be
prefixed to any public commands. 

EX: If $cmdchar_ is set to !, then main script trigger is: !helper
    If $cmdchar_ is set to *, then main script trigger is: *helper

-Main Script - helperfiles variable---------------------------------------------
The $helperfiles variable is an array that includes all your helper
files. The format is pretty stright forward:

 set helperfiles {
  {trigger_name directory_path description}
                 }

Example using included help files:

set helperfiles {
 {pirch /home/eggdrop/help/pirch/   Questions about the Pirch IRC client}
 {irc   /home/eggdrop/help/irchelp/ General Questions about IRC}
}

This tells the script there is 2 helper files avaliable. A general Pirch
client help that is stored in /home/eggdrop/help/pirch/ and is accessed
via the pirch trigger, and a general irc help in the
/home/eggdrop/help/irchelp/ directory with the irc trigger.

-*.dat file format--------------------------------------------------------------
The helper files are converted from a flat file that can be easily
changed.

The compiler is mkhelper.

The format of the datafile is as follows:
 o Lines starting with a - is added to the main index
 o Lines starting with a ? begin a question
 o Lines starting with a space are added to the question file

Example:
-This is an example help file
?Question 1
 This would be the answer to question 1
?Question 2
 This would be the answer to question 2





That should be enough. Now the stuff no one reads.. If you like this or
any of the other programs/scripts I've done that you have or have seen,
please send me something for my time and testing.
